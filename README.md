# SDEtools for Python 3 
A library to estimate and simulate Stochastic Differential Equations.

This library is a collection of statistical methods to simulate and estimate non-deterministic differential equations. Inference of SDEs is a topic I personally find very interesting but while the tools for their deterministic counterparts are well-developed (and especially well-implemented), stochastic differential equations lack a common tool set in Python.

Currently implemented are strong schemes with different properties and besides the Euler scheme they all have first-order convergence.
